The NeeiLang Programming Language
=================================

NeeiLang (NL) is a lightweight programming language that is under 
construction. It is designed to be:

*  Performant : emits native code with a minimal runtime system
*  Type-safe  : via aggressive type-checking and semantic analyses
*  Effortless : GC, minimal C-like syntax, ~15 keywords

not a production-grade language toolchain.

Building - LLVM backend
-----------------------
The LLVM backend is programmed against LLVM 9.0.0 API. Since common
package manger repositories only offer newer versions, you'll need to
build from source:
* Download the LLVM 9.0.0 source code from https://releases.llvm.org/
* Extract and build locally (it's a CMake project)
* symlink `/usr/bin/llvm-config-9` to `bin/llvm-config` so that CMake
  can locate LLVM 9 libraries and headers
* In the neeilang source dir, run `cmake`, then `make`

Building - x86-64 backend
-------------------------
* In the neeilang source dir, run `cmake -DTARGET_X86=ON`, then `make`
