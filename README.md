The NeeiLang Programming Language
=================================

NeeiLang (NL) is a lightweight programming language that is under 
construction. It is designed to be:

*  Performant : emits native code with a minimal runtime system
*  Type-safe  : via aggressive type-checking and semantic analyses
*  Effortless : GC, minimal C-like syntax, ~15 keywords
